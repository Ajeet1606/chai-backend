Project Setup:
- npm init
- create Readme.md 
- git init
- create gitignore
- create public & public/temp for storing images.
- git doesn't track empty folders, so we add a .gitkeep file.
- install nodemon for restarting the server on each change.
- create src
- create app.js, constants.js & index.js in src.
- create folders: controllers, db, models, routes, utils.
- install prettier on project basis not on vs code: when multiple people are working on same project, they can have different spacing config etc, which can lead to conflicts sometimes, so when prettier is working inside project, it has a localized setting, it keeps same for all.
- to setup prettier:
    - create file .prettierrc in root.
    - create .prettierignore file: to not apply prettier settings in some files.
